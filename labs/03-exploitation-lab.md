# Lab 03 â€” Exploitation (Safe Lab Targets)

## Objective
Practice exploiting known vulnerable services in a controlled/lab environment (e.g., DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, Metasploitable).

## Prerequisites
- Local lab or boxed VM (DVWA, Juice Shop, Metasploitable, TryHackMe challenge)
- Burp Suite Community / Proxy tools
- Metasploit installed (optional)
- Snapshot/restore available (so you can revert VM state)

## Tools
- Burp Suite (intercept & manipulate)
- SQLMap (automated SQLi testing)
- Metasploit (exploit framework)
- Browser DevTools, curl
- Vulnerable target (DVWA / Juice Shop)

## Steps
1. **Confirm consent & scope:** ensure target is local lab.
2. **Identify vulnerability:** using previous enumeration, find a likely vuln (e.g., SQLi form, file upload).
3. **Manual verification:** use Burp to craft a proof-of-concept (PoC) without destructive payloads.
4. **Use safe exploit techniques:** SQLMap or a controlled payload to demonstrate impact (read-only or limited).
5. **Exploit with caution:** do not run destructive commands; prefer non-persistent PoC.
6. **Capture evidence:** screenshots, request/response pairs, commands used.
7. **Restore environment:** revert VM snapshot after testing if needed.

## Deliverables
- PoC documentation: steps to reproduce, HTTP requests, screenshots.
- Impact assessment: what data or access could an attacker gain?
- Suggested remediation steps.

## Safety & Legal
- Never exploit a real-world target without explicit written permission.
- Keep exploits contained; avoid creating persistent backdoors in shared environments.
