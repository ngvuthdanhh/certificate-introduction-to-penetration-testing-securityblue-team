# Lab 05 — Reporting & Remediation Planning

## Objective
Create a professional penetration test report based on lab findings. Practice writing both executive and technical sections.

## Prerequisites
- Findings from previous labs (PoCs, screenshots, risk ratings)
- Template or checklist for reporting

## Tools
- Markdown editor or Word/Google Docs
- Screenshot files, logs, and exported outputs

## Steps
1. **Executive summary:** write a short non-technical overview of scope, high-level findings, and overall risk.
2. **Methodology:** describe tools and methods used (brief).
3. **Findings:** for each vulnerability include:
   - Title & severity (CVSS or simple high/medium/low)
   - Description (what is it)
   - PoC (requests, screenshots)
   - Impact (business/contextual)
   - Remediation (concrete steps)
4. **Prioritization:** provide a remediation roadmap (urgent → medium → low).
5. **Appendices:** raw outputs, full nmap scans, timestamps, and evidences.
6. **Review:** make the report concise for execs and detailed for engineers.

## Deliverables
- Complete penetration test report (PDF or Markdown)
- Separate technical appendix with raw evidence and command logs

## Safety & Legal
- Strip any real user data from shared reports.
- If this were a real engagement, follow responsible disclosure timelines and coordinate fixes.
