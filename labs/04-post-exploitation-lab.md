# Lab 04 — Post-Exploitation (Privilege Escalation & Data Discovery)

## Objective
Practice safe post-exploitation techniques in a lab: privilege escalation, credential harvesting, and lateral movement simulation.

## Prerequisites
- Compromised lab VM (you must have obtained initial access in lab)
- Local copy of VM snapshot to restore
- Tools: LinPEAS, WinPEAS, mimikatz (Windows lab caution)

## Tools
- LinPEAS / WinPEAS (enumeration)
- sudo/gsudo checks (Linux)
- mimikatz (Windows, use only in isolated lab)
- netstat / ss / ps / tasklist for process checks

## Steps
1. **Confirm scope & timebox actions:** maintain logs.
2. **Enumerate for escalation vectors:** run LinPEAS/WinPEAS to find SUID, weak sudo, kernel exploits, unpatched services.
3. **Credential harvesting (lab-only):** check for plaintext credentials in files, environment variables, or scripts.
4. **Privilege escalation:** apply a controlled exploit or use discovered misconfiguration to elevate privileges (prefer manual technique over automatic exploit).
5. **Persistence (simulation only):** discuss approaches but avoid creating real persistent backdoors; if demonstrating, use ephemeral techniques that are removed afterward.
6. **Data discovery:** identify sensitive files (e.g., config files, private keys) and document findings without exfiltrating them.
7. **Clean-up & restore:** remove any test artifacts and revert snapshot.

## Deliverables
- Escalation path documentation (commands, outputs, level gained)
- List of sensitive items found and remediation recommendations
- Timeline of actions (timestamps)

## Safety & Legal
- Post-exploitation tools like mimikatz are highly sensitive — use only on your isolated lab VMs.
- Never use harvested credentials outside the lab environment.
