# Sample Vulnerability Findings

Below is a structured example of how to document vulnerabilities in penetration testing reports.

---

## 1. SQL Injection in Login Form
- **Severity:** Critical  
- **Affected Asset:** https://example.com/login  
- **Description:** The login form does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.  
- **Impact:** An attacker can bypass authentication and access administrator accounts.  
- **Evidence:**  
  ```sql
  Payload: ' OR '1'='1
  ```
## This payload allowed login without valid credentials.

Recommendation:

Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements)

Apply strict input validation and output encoding

Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as an additional control

## 2. Outdated Apache Server

Severity: Medium

Affected Asset: 192.168.1.15 (Apache/2.4.29)

Description: The target server runs an outdated version of Apache with multiple known vulnerabilities.

Impact: Potential for remote code execution via CVE-2019-0211.

Evidence:

```bash
nmap -sV --script http-server-header 192.168.1.15
```
Output: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)

Recommendation: Upgrade Apache to the latest supported version (2.4.62 or higher).

## 3. Weak TLS Configuration

Severity: Low

Affected Asset: https://example.com

Description: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are enabled, which are deprecated.

Impact: May allow downgrade or man-in-the-middle attacks.

Evidence: SSL Labs Scan Score: B (due to legacy protocols)

Recommendation: Disable TLS 1.0/1.1 and enforce TLS 1.2+ with modern ciphersuites
